# Drug Detection
Adding drug details to a system without typing can be challenging if there is no code on its pack. Though there should be at least one type of code printed on the pack such as a barcode, some manufacturers still don't print any codes on their products. This leads to a tough workload for pharmacy technicians because they have to create new barcodes for such products. This repository includes a solution to detect drug details from the packagings, but some parts are removed until publishing a detailed article of this solution.

The solution includes use of:
1) OCR
2) Image pre-processing
3) Fuzzy matching
4) Spelling correction
